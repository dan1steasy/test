TODO:
* Add checkboxes to licences/list view to delete multiple licences
* Add account name to licence edit page
* Add account name to licence adding page, with multiple check box disabling this field, as it is only applicable to single licences
* Add ability to free up a licence (via accounts/show and licences/list) - mark it as not in use.
* Add search functionality to accounts_controller.rb
* Finish IP address searching
* Finish IP address viewing
* Implement cabinet editing and deleting

FEATURE IDEAS:
* Create a naming history functionality for hardware
* Make it possible to add IP addresses using CIDR notation
* Implement a clever search for domain names, incorporating real-time DNS checks and/or searching hardware history. Useful for if we rename a server.
* Implement service history for hardware - track faults, crashes, etc
* Implement a quota system for accounts (allow us to track bandwidth, disk quota & power)
* Implement SSL certificates for accounts
