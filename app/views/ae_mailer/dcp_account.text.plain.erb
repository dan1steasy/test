1ST EASY DCP LOGIN DETAILS:

Dear <%= @contact.full_name %>

Welcome to the Domain Control Panel (DCP) from 1st Easy. The DCP provides functionality for you to make it easier for you to both manage existing domains and add new ones. Please read carefully the information below as it contains crucial information needed for accessing the DCP.


MANAGEMENT OF YOUR DOMAINS IS EASY!

Quick, simple and secure. Key features of your new renewal and registration system include:

 * Renewal of multiple domains with a single transaction.
 * Search and purchase of new domain names.
 * The ability to make adjustments to your existing domain settings (e.g. DNS, contact details).
 * The incorporation of a token purchase system, whereby you purchase tokens that can be used to renew and purchase domains. As long as you're in credit, you no longer need to use your payment card each time you need to make a transaction.

 
 GETTING STARTED: DOMAIN CONTROL PANEL LOGIN AND PASSWORD RECOVERY:

An account has automatically been created for you. You can login to your new domain control panel to manage your domains by clicking on the link below and logging in. In order to register or renew domains, you first need to pay for tokens, either by the provided (recommended) online method, or by manual payment by cheque or bank transfer (minimum Â£30.00 + VAT for 30 tokens).

Once in your Account, please check your details and update accordingly. Please also review the terms and conditions of use, which can be found through the My Account drop down menu.
